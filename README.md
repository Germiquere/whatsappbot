# WHATSAPPBOT
The project is a server that connects to WhatsApp via QR code and interfaces with an  AI assistant from SuperAgent to automatically respond to inquiries.
In this case, the bot is a car salesman for the agency called "DREAMCAR".The assistant has the ability to remember its ongoing conversations and can respond to questions based on the context of those ones.
